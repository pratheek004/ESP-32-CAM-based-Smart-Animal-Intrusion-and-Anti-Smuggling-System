ESP32-CAM Based Smart Animal Intrusion & Anti-Smuggling System
🔐 AI-Powered Farm Security | 🐄 Animal Detection | 👤 Face Recognition | 🌐 IoT Web Dashboard | 🚪 Automated Gate Control
📌 Overview

This project presents an AI-enabled smart security system designed for farms and livestock sheds.
It integrates ESP32-CAM, Ultrasonic sensors, Arduino-controlled servo gate locking, and a Flask-based webserver with Machine Learning detection for:

Human intruder detection

Known vs unknown face recognition

Animal classification (Cow, Dog, Cat, Rabbit)

Web-controlled gate locking/unlocking

Real-time auto-capture and manual capture options

This low-cost system provides 24×7 automated monitoring, reducing the need for manual supervision.
